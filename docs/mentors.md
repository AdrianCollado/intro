# Mentors

## Mentors

Mentors are the blood of RCOS, a mentor can help you with technical problems, show
you where/how to find help for your project, and help you find a new project etc.

*TODO mentor responsibilites, how to be a good mentor, stuff mentors should know etc.*

## Student Coordinators

Student coordinators are mentors that organize the first couple weeks as well
as the large group meetings.
