## First Meeting (Tuesday)

The first meeting begins on a tuesday.

The first meeting begins with the [rcos introduction slides](https://rcos.github.com/intro). The slides go through the history and several of the RCOS Concepts. It is stated that existing projects will pitch on Friday (giving time for people who are new to RCOS to join the project). Pitch slides are collected by a coordinator.

Existing projects are reminded to submit proposals. Existing projects are asked to fill out a form expressing their small group mentor/technology preference.

## Second Meeting (Friday)

Mentors must be selected by this day. Small group assignments should be made.

Existing projects pitch. Small groups are introduced via the [small group slides](https://rcos.github.com/intro/smallgroups.html). RCOS Members are reminded that they should go to their assigned small group on Tuesday (it is a good idea to iterate through the small groups with all the members in the slides). 

## Third Meeting (Tuesday)

Mentees go to their small group rooms. One coordinator remains in the large group room to direct confused students. Mentors get students set up.

Mentors ensure that mentees
1. Are on [rcos.io](https://rcos.io).
2. Are on [rcos.slack.com](https://rcos.slack.com)
3. Understand the specifics of their small group.
4. Have a project. If a student does not have a project, ask them what their preference is and try to find the best project for them. This is difficult. Utilize the pitches/slides from Friday and [github.com/explore](https://github.com/explore).
5. Understand how to fill out the forms.

## Fourth Meeting (Friday)

Everyone goes to RCOS large group. Forms are handed in at end of session. New projects are introduced. Presentation on how to present in RCOS (rules and guidelines for presenting) is shown.
