# Grading

## Overview

RCOS is largely a self-guided class, which can make grading difficult. Instructors
use utilities such as [Observatory](https://rcos.io/) to make turn open source
contributions and community involvement into appropriate grades. Generally
speaking, if you're contributing to the community and/or making valuable
open-source contributions you'll receive a high grade in RCOS.

## Grade Levels

Beginning in Fall 2016, RCOS will begin accepting 4 credit levels for RCOS students.
Higher credit levels generally entail more commitment and responsibility, while
lower credit levels take less time and require less objectives.

The following table represents a general rule-of-thumb for metrics that every
RCOS member should keep track of (see [grading metrics](#grading-metrics) for
longer descriptions of each metric).

| Credit Level | Blog Posts | Attendance                     | Avg weekly Contributions | Small Group Presentations | Large Group Presentations | External Contribution | Documentation Review |
|--------------|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| 1            | 2          | 3 absences, 1 bonus session    | 1                        | 2                         | 0                         | X                     | X                    |

## Grading Metrics

### Blog Posts

Blog posts are a way to explain the high level goals of a project, to indicate
that a project is struggling (someone in RCOS might be able to help!) or just
to document tasks that don't fall easily into other categories.

If the instructor feels that the blog post doesn't add value to the project, if
it's poorly written or very short, it may not be counted. Check with your mentor
if you're not sure your blog post is good enough!

It's a good idea to have a blog post at the beginning of the semester and end of
the semester to indicate what you hope to do, then what you were able to do (or
what you decided to do instead.)

### Attendance

Being part of the RCOS community means seeing what RCOS members are doing, giving
feedback, and learning from tech talks and guest speakers. RCOS attendance goes
through observatory, and depending on the number of credits you take you are
allowed to skip a certain number of lectures.

There are a certain number of required bonus sessions, which take place after
RCOS (within the 2 hour time block) or at a day announced at a large group
meeting. If you attend over your required number of bonus sessions, a bonus
session counts as normal attendance.

Generally bonus sessions are unique, long or workshop-style tech talks, a
RCOS hackathon, or an optional RCOS session. Pay attention in the large group
meeting to hear bonus sessions announced.

### Average Weekly Contributions

Weekly contributions can be anything from creating issues, commenting on pull
requests or committing code to a repository. Contributions should indicate
community involvement (e.g. a pull request that is reviewed by peers) rather than
"working alone publicly". If you are on an RCOS project alone, it is admissable
to commit directly to a repository.

### Small Group Presentations

Small group presentations help give projects critical feedback or resolve issues,
a mentor will organize presentations at the beginning of the semester in an early
small group.

### Large Group Presentations

Large group presentations usually do not receive feedback, and should be tailored
to engaging the RCOS community. See [rcos presentations](http://rcos.github.io/intro/presentations#/)
for more details.

### External Contribution

Contribute to something outside of RCOS! External contributions show that RCOS
is helping projects outside of RPI and is very encouraged.

### Documentation Review

You're project should live on outside of RCOS! You should have a README, instructions
for developers to work on the project and some form of documentation. Instructors
will go through the documentation and make sure that your project could potentially
have a life outside of RCOS.

Making a website is an encouraged way of showing off your project outside of RCOS.

## Individual and Group Grading

RCOS is a team sport, but when grading instructors can only look at the individual.
Make sure that you meet the requirements!
